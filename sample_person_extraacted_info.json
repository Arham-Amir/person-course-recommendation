            "description": "Cleanrooms are highly controlled environments where the air quality is monitored to ensure the extreme standards of cleanliness required for the manufacture of pharmaceutical, electronic, and healthcare goods. These stringent standards usually require high fresh air rates, extensive filtering, temperature, and humidity control - all of which results in increased energy usage. Protection from uncontrolled ingress of external ambient air is achieved by creating a pressure differential between the cleanroom and its surroundings."

There is little, however, devoted to the training and qualification of staff \nworking in the microbiological laboratory itself."

            "description": "Occasionally, the sterility test will produce a positive result.  This demands both an examination of the laboratory test and an examination of the production  process to determine why the sterility test failure occurred.   The conclusion of such an  investigation will be either that the sterility test was invalid due to some type of \u201claboratory  error\u201d (a position for which a great deal of caution is required, given that regulatory agencies  require a robust rationale), or that the product was contaminated due to some event or incident in  the manufacturing or filling of the product. This article examines some of the areas to consider  when looking at sterility test failures."

            "description": "The pharmacopoeial monographs for the  Limulus  amebocyte lysate (LAL) test (USP  <85> and Ph. Eur. 2.6.14) are long established and relatively comprehensive, and have  been applied to the testing of parenteral products and water systems for bacterial  endotoxin for three decades. Nevertheless, the issue of beta-glucans and the  relationship of these substances to the LAL test remains an important area not  described in great detail in compendial or regulatory documents. \u03b2-Glucans (betaglucans) are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by \u03b2-glycosidic bonds.  Glucans are important because they can react with certain lysates and cause  interference with the LAL test."

            "description": "Environmental monitoring of cleanrooms provides an indication of the state of control  of a facility. Control is assessed in terms of trends analysis. There are two important  types of trend analysis: microbial count and the types of microorganisms isolated. \nThis article addresses some of the reasons for characterizing the types of  microorganisms found in cleanrooms and discusses some of the methods used to  achieve species identification. Identification is  the determination of whether a  microorganism should be placed within a group of organisms known to fit within  some classification scheme."

            "description": "Environmental monitoring describes the microbiological testing undertaken in order to detect  changing trends of microbial count and microflora within cleanroom environments. It is not  the same as environmental control (which is outlined in standards such as 21 CFR Part  820.70). Environmental monitoring does, however, relate to environmental control in that  monitoring should ideally be targeted where the control is weakest. The results from  environmental monitoring obtained provide information about the performance of the  physical design of the room (most notably the HVAC system) and the performance of the  people, equipment, and cleaning operations within the cleanroom."
